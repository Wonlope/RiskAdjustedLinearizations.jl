euler_equation_error(m, c‚Çú, logSDFxR, ùîº_quadrature, shock_matrix, p, z‚Çú)
```
calculates standard Euler equation errors, as recommended by Judd (1992).
The first method calculates the error at some state `z‚Çú`, which defaults
to the stochastic steady state. The second method simulates the state
vector from an initial state `z‚Çú` (defaults to stochastic steady state)
given a sequence of drawn shocks and evaluates the Euler equation errors
according to one of three norms (see below).

The Euler equation is
``math
\\begin{aligned}
0 = \\log \\mathbb{E}_t \\exp(m_{t + 1} + r_{t + 1}) = \\log \\mathbb{E}_t[M_{t + 1} R_{t + 1}],
\\end{aligned}
``
where ``m_{t + 1} = \\log(M_{t + 1})`` is the log stochastic discount factor and ``r_{t + 1} = \\log(R_{t + 1})``
is the risk free rate.

### Inputs
- `m::RiskAdjustedLinearization`: A solved instance of a risk-adjusted linearization
- `c‚Çú::Function`: a function of `(m, z‚Çú)` that calculates consumption at state `z‚Çú`, given the
    state-space representation implied by `m`.
- `logSDFxR::Function`: a `Function` evaluating ``m_{t + 1} + r_{t + 1}``. The `Function` must
    take as input `(m, z‚Çú, Œµ‚Çú‚Çä‚ÇÅ, c‚Çú)`, where `m` is a `RiskAdjustedLinearization`,
    `z‚Çú` is a state vector at which to evaluate, `Œµ‚Çú‚Çä‚ÇÅ` is a draw from the distribution
    of exogenous shocks, and `c‚Çú` is the a guess for consumption at `z‚Çú` implied by
    the conditional expectation in the Euler equation when calculated with a quadrature rule.
- `ùîº_quadrature::Function`: a quadrature rule whose single input is a `Function` with a single
    input, which is a shock `Œµ‚Çú‚Çä‚ÇÅ`.
- `z‚Çú::AbstractVector`: a state at which to evaluate the Euler equation error
- `shock_matrix::Abstractmatrix`: a `NŒµ √ó T` matrix of shocks drawn from the distribution of exogenous shocks.
- `p::Number`: norm at which to evaluate the errors. This norm can be (a) `p=1` for expected absolute error,
    (b) `p=2` for expected squared error, and (c) `p=Inf` for maximum absolute error.
